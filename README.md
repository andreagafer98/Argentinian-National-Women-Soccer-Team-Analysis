# Argentinian-National-Women-Soccer-Team-Analysis

### Overview

Leveraging the power of data analytics in the world of sports can provide an advantage against other teams. In preparation for the games on May 31st and June 1st 2024 against the Argentina Women’s National Soccer Team, the Costa Rican team was looking to use data analytics to develop a recommendation strategy to guide their practices effectively.
The dataset analyzed was based on Argentina’s last seven games from the Women’s Gold Cup and the World Cup, which offered insights into their tactical patterns and key players.

### Objectives

Using Python for data analysis, the goal was to answer the following specific questions:

1. Predicted Starting XI 
2. Players with the Most Line-Breaking Passes 
3. Most Repeated Passing Patterns between Defenders 
4. Player Who Delivers the Most Forward Passes After Recovering the Ball 
5. Player with the Most Successful Receptions
6. Most Common Crossing Patterns 
7. Player with the Most 1v1 Duels Won

### Key Insights and Recommendations

The findings helped to identify Argentina’s strengths and suggested ways to neutralize them:

1. Block Passing Lines:
- Between Aldana Cometti and Celeste Dos Santos
- Between Aldana Cometti and Eliana Stábile
- Between Mirian Mayorga and Romina Núñez
2. Neutralize Key Defenders:
3. Develop a strategy to disrupt Aldana Cometti and Vanina Preininger, who are crucial to Argentina’s defense in recovering balls and initiating counterattacks.
4. Target Key Receivers:
- Anticipate and mark Dálila Ippolito and Vanina Preininger, Argentina’s primary ball receivers in the Gold Cup.
5. Prevent Dangerous Crosses:
- Focus on stopping early crosses, particularly from Eliana Stábile, who is the most effective crosser on the left flank with a 33% success rate.
